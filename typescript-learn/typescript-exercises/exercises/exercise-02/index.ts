Intro:

    Since we already have some of the additional
    information about our users, it's a good idea
    to output it in a nice way.

Exercise:

    Fix type errors in logPerson function.

    logPerson function should accept both User and Admin
    and should output relevant information according to
    the input: occupation for User and role for Admin.

Run:

    npm run 2

    - OR -

    yarn -s 2
